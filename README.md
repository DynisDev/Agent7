An open source penetration testing tool




Agent7 was created in the interest of helping others. This open source, free penetration testing tool is designed to create a simple, yet secure environment for testing your code, while implementing safeguards to stop you from attacking others. If you are here to hack, leave. If you are here to test the integrity of your website, ftp server, or even just a normal password, go no further. Agent7 will   NEVER release any information about vulnerabilities and passwords.
